Cutting into vehicle platoons represents a hazardous driving maneuver that significantly impacts the safety and efficiency of platooning vehicles. Accurate prediction of such maneuvers plays a pivotal role in enabling platooning systems to proactively implement safety measures that guarantee the well-being and cohesion of the platoon. This project seeks to develop a robust predictive model using the NGSIM dataset, which contains detailed information on vehicle trajectories. By harnessing machine learning techniques and advanced data analysis, our model aims to assess the danger level associated with lane changes, thereby empowering platooning systems to make informed decisions to enhance the overall safety and integrity of the platoon. Through this research, we aim to contribute to the advancement of autonomous driving systems and pave the way for safer and more efficient transportation solutions.
